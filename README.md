## How it works:

insert the rectangle's data in the order the program asks and it will return the result.

## Hou to run project:

git clone https://github.com/apatrickrs/RectangleKaffa.git

Open with the editor of your choice, I recommend VSCode, as it is easier to open the project, enter the folder where the project was cloned and open the terminal inside the folder and run the command "code.", Wait for it to load the code and then run.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
